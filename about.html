<h1 class="border" style="padding: 10px;">About me</h1>

<p>
I'm dumb. And that's pretty much all you need to know.<br>
I can be really annoying and infantile sometimes, I feel like i haven't grown up at all.<br>
At the time of me writing this, I'm 16, so yeah that's a fun time (not at all).
</p>

<p>
I have a cat &lt3
</p>

<p>
Procrastination AAAAAAAAAGHHH dang it! I'm so bad at finishing things, I have tons of ideas but complete none of them!<br>
I get easily stressed and scared by things. Anything related to socializing makes me melt completely.
</p>

<p>
Also I'm probably a furry. Honestly so far I have met a lot nice people and had fun. So that's that.<br>
I love foxes btw, they're so cute.

<p>
I like computer-related things, like hey!
I'm making this website on my own, so far it's been really educational (I think).<br>
I have a bit of experience with C# and unity.
</p>

<p>
Recently I've been experimenting with digital art in Krita, 
so far I'm actually surprised that my art doesn't look like a complete dumpster fire
(even more so considering I'm using a damn mouse for drawing)<br>
I first do sketches on paper then trace them with a mouse, or else I would die.

    <h1>Music!</h1>
    <p>Idk anything about music theory, but I'm interested in learning to make music one day.</p>
