<h1 class="round-border--heading">About me</h1>

<div class="round-border--panel">
    <p>
    I'm dumb. And that's pretty much all you need to know.<br>
    I can be really annoying and infantile sometimes, I feel like i haven't grown up at all.<br>
    At the time of me writing this, I'm 16, so yeah that's a fun time (not at all).
    </p>

    <p>
    I have a cat &lt3
    </p>

    <p>
    Procrastination AAAAAAAAAGHHH dang it! I'm so bad at finishing things, I have tons of ideas but complete none of them!<br>
    I get easily stressed and scared by things. Anything related to socializing makes me melt completely.
    </p>

    <p>
    Also I'm probably a furry. Honestly so far I have met a lot nice people and had fun. So that's that.<br>
    I love foxes btw, they're so cute.
    </p>

    I watch a lot of Youtube, like a lot. I get reccomended a lot of memes and steal most of them,
    I have 2000+ screenshots on my phone.

        <p>
        I like computer-related things, like hey!
        I'm making this website on my own, so far it's been really educational (I think).<br>
        I have a bit of experience with C# and unity.
        </p>
        <p>
        Recently I've been experimenting with digital art in Krita, 
        so far I'm actually surprised that my art doesn't look like a complete dumpster fire
        (even more so considering I'm using a damn mouse for drawing)<br>
        I first do sketches on paper then trace them with a mouse, or else I would die.

        Yay! ^w^ I got a drawing tablet a couple of months ago :3<br>
        I think I'm improving! I think... >w&lt<br>
        It's definitely a million times better than drawing with a mouse!! I don't do physical sketches anymore :3

    <h1>Nostalgia zone</h1>
    <p>
    I think I'm actually very lucky to have Windows XP as my first operative system,
    I had a tower PC and ran awful (probably because I had like a thousand viruses and programs), but it was awesome.
    </p>

    <p>
    I actually started making 'games' or rather animations with Power Point, then moved on to Game Maker 8 and later to Unity 4.<br>
    Again, I think I'm very lucky to have experienced this, as other people at my age probably wouldn't know what Game Maker 8 is and that's honestly a shame.<br>
    I think some of the extensions that Game Maker 8 had may become lost media! Since YoYoGames deleted the old forums.<br>
    </p>

    <p>
    The same with Unity 4, I remember playing around with the pre-made controllers assets, oh what a shame that they're not packaged with Unity anymore...
    </p>

    <p>
    Oh yeah, the Wii and my DS, those were such good times :'3<br>
    I absolutely love Super Mario Galaxy, everytime I hear the soundtrack I get a nostalgia overdose.
    </p>

    <h1>Music!</h1>
    <p>Idk anything about music theory, but I'm interested in learning to make music one day.</p>
    <p>I really like this "sound" that 80s music has, i think its called "tri stereo chorus", such a magical sound...</p>
    <a href=https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcWSvO0RQon-X1KkQOfgf4i_5BuAdkDTZ>My youtube music playlist!!!</a>
